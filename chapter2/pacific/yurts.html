    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <!--dl>(dt+dd)*3-->
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas
            walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
            experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
            are located in the lodge.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of
            clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
