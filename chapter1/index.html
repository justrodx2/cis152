<p>Kolashanpan is a popular Salvadoran soda that reminds me of home every time I drink it. It has a sweet, creamy flavor
    that is different from regular colas and tastes a little like vanilla and bubblegum mixed together. I love how
    refreshing it is on a hot day, especially when it is ice-cold from the fridge. The bright orange color makes it
    stand out, and it is the first drink I look for at Latin markets. Drinking Kolashanpan always brings back good
    memories of family, food, and celebrations.</p>
